					<li>Reproducible searches, through query URLs.</li>
					<li>Basic BLUEPRINT data release metrics.</li>
					<li>Search field with autocomplete capabilities, based on EnsEMBL, GENCODE and REACTOME dumps, which understands union (+) and difference (-) set operators.</li>
					<li>Default flanking window around the query regions obtained from the search.</li>
					<li>Any chart can be saved as a graphics file (PNG, JPG, PDF, SVG), as well as the data series used to generate the chart.</li>
					<li>Queries (genes, transcripts, pathways, ...) can return one or more query regions. Each query region is shown as a tab.</li>
					<li>Features found in the query region are enumerated, providing links to their authoritative web sites.</li>
					<li>Metadata (donors, samples, analysis, ...) related to each query region is available to be browsed and saved.</li>
					<li>On the second step, the user can enable which cellular types with analysis results desires to watch.</li>

					<li>There are several views which allow exploring the analysis data from different points of view. As of BDAP version 0.9.1, the available views are general, by tissue, and diseases by cellular type.</li>
					<li>Each cellular type with data on the query region is listed. Their data series on all the charts can be switched on and off at once. For each cellular type is possible to see the names of the samples with data on the query region.</li>
					<li>Segment-based scatter plots are used for almost each chart type, like regulatory regions, methylation data and histone marks. Boxplot charts are used for gene and transcript expression.</li>
					<li>Start and stop codons, gene regions, and gene start and stop features are shown on step charts.</li>
					<li>Each chart can be (1) maximized or restored; (2) hidden; (3) chart legend can be shown / hidden; (4) data supporting visible series in the chart can be browsed and saved.</li>
